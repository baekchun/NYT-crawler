BEIJING — President Trump will arrive in China on Wednesday backed by campaign-trail promises to get tough against the United States’ largest trading partner. He will be accompanied by the chiefs of some of the country’s most ambitious and influential companies: Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Westinghouse Electric and Qualcomm, among others.
The expected outcome: Not much, to the frustration of some American business executives.
Mr. Trump’s meetings this week with Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other Chinese leaders come at a difficult time for both countries. Each has been consumed with domestic issues: West Wing infighting and a special counsel investigation in Washington, a sensitive leadership transition in Beijing.
The Trump administration in particular has been stretched thin on trade. It has been slow to fill important trade-related positions, because of distractions and the lengthy congressional confirmation process. The administration has been preoccupied with rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement and a United States trade deal with South Korea.
Trade has also been supplanted by North Korea as the most talked-about issue in Northeast Asia for President Trump — and an issue on which he wants Chinese cooperation, not confrontation. And with the administration also trying to push tax policy changes through Congress, two top economic officials are not even joining the trip, but staying in Washington: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council.
As a result, planning for Mr. Trump’s Beijing trip has largely focused on finding deals he can announce, like high-profile orders for Boeing jets and other American goods. By contrast, the two sides have engaged in little of the back-and-forth shuttle diplomacy by lower-ranking officials that can pave the way toward new trade agreements.
“From what I understand, there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit,” said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, a group that has worked closely with American trade negotiators for decades, “which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues.”
Chinese and American officials offered a taste on Wednesday, when they disclosed a series of deals they valued at $9 billion ahead of an event planned for Thursday with the two presidents. One, the sale of 50 Bell helicopters to a Chinese buyer, represented the kind of industrial export that Mr. Trump called for during his campaign. But several others were food sales that might do little to strengthen the United States’ industrial base. Many of the details were not disclosed.
The lack of progress on trade issues has led to grumbling among business types.
Several financial firms were interested in attending the trip to discuss Chinese restrictions on bank ownership, but they decided to pull back when they learned that the Trump administration was focused on making deals rather than pushing for structural reform, said an industry source who is familiar with the negotiations, who declined to be identified while discussing internal deliberations.
Trump administration officials say there has been more preparation on trade issues than meets the eye for the current trip, and they add that they have been laying the groundwork to do more in the coming months. These efforts include an investigation into Chinese infringement of American intellectual property, which could lead the administration to impose tariffs or other significant limits on Chinese goods. They also include an effort to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, complemented by congressional legislation that is expected to be introduced soon. There are also investigations into limiting imports of solar panels, steel, aluminum foil and other goods mainly from China that the administration contends are subsidized by the Chinese government.
Those efforts have been proceeding slowly. As a result, the preparatory work for the summit meeting has been led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose agency focuses more on corporate transactions.
Some companies declined to join the trip, afraid of provoking reprisals by the Chinese government or of being perceived as too close to the Trump administration and its controversies. But more than two dozen were planning to attend, including smaller firms like Stine Seed, the solar project developer SolarReserve and the wastewater treatment company Drylet.
Critics say these commercial deals will do little to address the bigger economic imbalances between the countries.
“There are a lot of deals in the works,” David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said at a conference in Washington on Oct. 31. “They do not reflect a change in policy.”
China has nonetheless been considering opening some narrowly targeted sectors to greater international competition. Beijing ministries have particularly looked at whether to allow greater investment in Chinese service industries. In a briefing Oct. 31, a senior administration official said improving trade competitiveness in services would be one of the White House’s top priorities for the trip. Chinese officials said they were open to that.
“Our manufacturing industries opened up relatively early with relatively wide areas,” said Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman. “In contrast, service industries opened up relatively late. We need to expand the opening up of services while we deepen the opening up of manufacturing.”
More American investment in the Chinese service sectors may not do much to help the heavily blue-collar workers in Rust Belt states who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency a year ago. These workers have absorbed the brunt of job losses from Chinese competition and technological change.
One service sector that may be ripe for opening is banking. China has begun reviewing how it has hamstrung foreign banks with a long list of regulations that limit the services they can offer and cap their ownership stakes in Chinese banks. Those rules have left foreign banks with a combined market share of just 1.5 percent of the Chinese banking system’s assets.
Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said during a news conference on the sidelines of the recent Communist Party congress that he saw room for changes. “We will further open up and give more space to foreign banks in the types of establishments, the credentials of stakeholders, the percentage of stakes they hold, and the range of businesses,” he said.
China has already made it a little easier for international asset managers to operate investment funds in China and allowed big institutions like Citibank to establish toeholds in China’s bond market by granting them narrowly defined trading licenses.
But a separate issue has cropped up this year: China’s ever-tightening cybersecurity rules. These regulations have dimmed considerably the American banking sector’s enthusiasm to start making large investments in China, particularly in commercial banking.
China has issued new rules — although they have been paused because of bitter complaints from bankers — that would require banks to buy most of the telecommunications equipment they use in China from Chinese suppliers and to store their Chinese data in China.
“It’s still very much on the minds of our bankers,” said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. “That is not something they are eager to do.”

北京——带着竞选时要对美国最大贸易伙伴强硬起来的承诺，特朗普总统将于周三抵达北京（本文英文版发表于11月7日——编注）。随行的有美国几家最具雄心、影响力最大的公司领导人，包括波音(Boeing)、高盛(Goldman Sachs)、西屋电气(Westinghouse Electric)及高通(Qualcomm)。
预计成果：不会太多，一些美国商业高管因此会感到不满。
特朗普本周与中国国家主席习近平及其他中国领导人的会面，正值两国的艰难时期。中美都在为国内问题焦头烂额：白宫西翼内讧，华盛顿一位特别检察官正在进行调查；北京则是敏感的领导层权力过渡。
特朗普政府在贸易方面的人手尤其不够。由于受到干扰和冗长的国会确认流程，该政府在填补与贸易相关的重要职位空缺上动作缓慢。特朗普政府还在忙于重拟北美自由贸易协定以及一项美韩间的贸易协定。
朝鲜也已经取代了贸易，成为了特朗普谈得最多的东北亚问题——在这个问题上，他想得到中国的合作，而不是对抗。此外，由于特朗普政府希望国会通过税收政策方面的变动，有两位最高经济官员甚至都没有随行，而是留在了华盛顿：财政部长史蒂文·努钦(Steven Mnuchin)和国家经济委员会主任加里·D·科恩(Gary D. Cohn)。
因此，特朗普北京之行的筹备工作主要聚焦在找到他能够宣布的交易上，比如波音喷气式飞机及其他美国商品的高调订单。相比之下，双方都没怎么进行较低级别官员来来回回地穿梭外交，而这样的外交可以为新的贸易协定铺平道路。
“就我的理解而言，此次访问真的没有太多这类东西，”中国美国商会主席蔡瑞德(William Zarit)说道。数十年来，该组织一直与美国贸易谈判人员密切合作。“这让我们有点担心不会有太多关于结构性问题的讨论。”
在周四开展为两国领导人计划好的活动前，中国和美国的官员于周三公开了估值90亿美元的一系列交易，让人们得以一窥究竟。其中一个交易是向中国一个买家出售50架贝尔直升机，它代表着特朗普在竞选期间呼吁的工业出口。但其他几项交易都是关于食品销售，可能对加强美国工业基础没有什么作用。不少细节都没有公开。
贸易问题上缺乏进展，已经引得不少商界人士怨声载道。
一名熟悉此次磋商的行业人士说，有几家金融机构都有兴趣参加这次访问，讨论中国对银行所有权的限制，但当它们得知特朗普政府把重点放在了达成交易，而非推动结构性改革方面后，便纷纷退出了。由于是在讨论内部商议内容，他拒绝公开自己的姓名。
特朗普政府说，他们在贸易问题上的准备工作比目前的行程要多，他们还补充说，白宫一直在为未来几个月里做更多工作奠定基础。这些努力包括一项针对中国侵犯美国知识产权的调查，该调查将使特朗普政府向中国商品施加关税或其他重要限制。还包括一项收紧对中国在美投资的限制，国会预计也将很快推出相关立法。还有对限制太阳能板、钢铁、铝箔及其他主要来自于中国的商品进口的调查，政府认为这些商品都获得了中国政府的补贴。
上述努力的进展一直十分缓慢。因此，此次峰会的准备工作由商务部长威尔伯·罗斯(Wilbur Ross)牵头进行，他的机构更多地关注的是企业交易。
由于担心遭到中国政府报复，或者被认为过于接近特朗普政府以及围绕它的争议，一些公司拒绝参加此次访问。不过有二十多家公司计划参加，包括一些小型企业，例如斯泰种业公司(Stine Seed)、太阳能项目开发商SolarReserve，以及废水处理公司Drylet。
批评人士表示，这些商业交易无助于解决两国间更大的经济失衡问题。
“有很多交易正在进行中，”布鲁金斯学会(Brookings Institution)的高级研究员杜大伟(David Dollar)10月31日在华盛顿的一次会议上表示。“它们没有反映出政策上的变化。”
不过，中国一直在考虑开放某些有严格界定的领域，接纳更多的国际竞争。北京的各部委尤其关注是否允许中国的服务业接纳更多投资。在10月31日的一次简报会上，美国政府的一名高级官员表示，促进服务业的贸易竞争将是白宫此行的首要任务之一。中国官员表示，他们对此持开放态度。
“我国的制造业开放比较早、领域比较宽，”中国商务部发言人高峰说。“服务业开放相对滞后。需要在制造业进一步深度开放的同时，扩大服务业对外开放。”
美国对中国服务行业的更多投资，可能对一年前推动特朗普上台的“铁锈地带”(Rust Belt)各州的蓝领工人没有多大好处。这些工人受到了中国竞争和技术变革导致的失业的冲击。
银行业可能是一个适合开放的成熟服务行业。中国已经开始审视自己对外国银行的遏制，它制定了一系列监管规定，限制外国银行可以提供的服务以及它们在中资银行的最高持股比例。那些规定致使外国银行在中国银行体系资产中所占的总份额仅为1.5%。
中国银监会主席郭树清在前不久的党代会场外召开的新闻发布会上表示，他看到了改革的空间。“要加大对外开放，在设立形式、股东资质、持股比例、业务范围方面，给外资银行更大空间，”他说。
中国已经放宽了对国际资产管理公司在中国运营投资基金的规定，还通过授予范围很窄的贸易许可证，允许花旗银行(Citibank)等大型机构在中国的债券市场立足。
不过今年出现了另一个问题：中国日益收紧的网络安全规定。这些监管规定极大打击了美国银行业开始在中国进行大规模投资的热情，尤其是在商业银行领域。
中国之前就已经发布了新规定——尽管迫于银行业人士的强烈不满而暂停实施——要求银行从中国供应商那里购买在中国使用的大部分电信设备，并将中国的数据存储在中国。
“我们的银行家们绝对还在惦记着这件事，”上海美国商会(American Chamber of Commerce)会长季瑞达(Kenneth Jarrett)说。“他们可不愿意这么做。”
