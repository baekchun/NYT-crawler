MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has ordered military officials to stop construction work on a sandbar in a disputed area of the South China Sea after Beijing complained, the country’s defense chief said Wednesday.
China complained in August about the work on the sandbar at Sandy Cay, the Philippine defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, said. The sandbar is near Thitu Island, which Manila calls Pag-Asa island and claims as its own.
“They complained that we were occupying a new feature,” Lorenzana said, adding that the Philippine Defense Ministry had transported people there “to put structures for our fishermen.”
The resource-rich Spratly Islands are claimed in whole or in part by both nations, as well as by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has been creating artificial islands in the South China Sea, expanding former reefs and outcrops into guarded permanent outposts, increasing tensions with Washington, which has sent warships through the area.
Lorenzana said that Beijing had invoked an agreement between the Chinese and Philippine foreign ministers to maintain the status quo in the area, and not to occupy any new land features, in an effort to reduce tensions in the area. He said that Duterte had been informed of the “standoff” and had decided to halt construction on the sandbar.
“I agree with the decision because it was indeed a new feature,” Lorenzana said.
China claims ownership of a vast majority of the South China Sea, asserting rights even to waters near the shores of other nations.
A third of global maritime traffic passes through the South China Sea, making the disputes a source of contention, with defense strategists and analysts warning that competing ownership claims could lead to armed conflict.
The Philippines has contested many of China’s claims, but since assuming office last year, Duterte has taken a more conciliatory stance. The president, who is the current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hopes to begin negotiations this year for a code of conduct that would govern actions in the region. Duterte will host ASEAN leaders in Manila next week.
But some Philippine lawmakers oppose what they see as Duterte’s acquiescence to China.
Rep. Gary Alejano, a former marine captain who had warned of China’s increasing presence near Thitu, accused Duterte of buckling to Beijing, saying the Philippines could rightfully set up structures on the sandbar.
“There was no new occupation of the sandbars by the Philippines because these sandbars have been traditionally under effective control by Philippine troops,” he said.
Alejano noted that the sandbars in question, about 2.5 miles from Pag-Asa, were subject to regular patrols and visits by Philippine forces and fishermen.
“That is part of Duterte’s strategy of silence, inaction and subservience to China’s actions in the South China Sea,” he said.
In a speech Wednesday, Duterte highlighted his country’s warmer relations with Beijing.
“We are friends of China; we owe them a debt of gratitude,” he said, noting that the Chinese government had helped the Philippines by supplying arms to fight militants in Marawi, on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.

菲律宾马尼拉——菲律宾国防部高官周三表示，在中国提出抗议后，总统罗德里戈·杜特地(Rodrigo Duterte)已命令军方停止在南海争议地区一处沙洲上的建设工作。
菲律宾国防部长德芬·洛伦扎纳(Delfin Lorenzana)说，今年8月，中国曾对菲律宾在敦谦沙洲(Sandy Cay)的活动提出抗议。沙洲位于中业岛附近，菲律宾称之为“派格阿萨岛”(Pag-Asa)，并将其视为本国领土。
洛伦扎纳表示，“他们抗议我们占领了一个新地貌”。并补充说菲律宾国防部曾派人前往那里“为渔民搭建房屋”。
斯普拉特利群岛（Spratly Islands，中国称南沙群岛 ——译注）资源丰富，中菲双方以及文莱、马来西亚、台湾和越南都宣称对其拥有部分或全部主权。中国政府在南海填海造岛，将原有的礁石和外露的岩石填埋成有人驻守的永久性前哨。美国曾派军舰穿过该区域，加剧了中国与美国的紧张关系。
洛伦扎纳说，北京方面援引了两国外长之间的一项协议，该协议提出维持该地区现状，不再占领新的自然地貌(land feature)，从而缓解该地区紧张局势。他表示，杜特地得知这一“对峙”，决定叫停本国在沙洲的建设活动。
洛伦扎纳说：“我同意这个决定，因为这确实是一个新地貌。”
中国声称拥有南海几乎全部的主权，甚至包括距离其他国家海岸很近的一些水域。
全球三分之一的海上交通途经南海，这使争议成为了冲突之源。国防战略和分析人士警告，争相宣称主权或导致武装冲突。
菲律宾对中国的许多主张都表示质疑，但自从去年上任以来，杜特地表示出更缓和的态度。现任东盟(Association of Southeast Asian Nations)主席的杜特地希望于今年开始谈判，制定出能管理该地区行动的行为准则。杜特地将主持下周在马尼拉举办的东盟领导人会议。
但是一些菲律宾议员表示反对，他们认为杜特地这是默许了中国的行为。
曾是一名海军陆战队上尉的加里·亚历哈诺(Gary Alejano)议员警告，中国在中业岛附近的活动日益频繁，并指责杜特地向中国屈服，还表示，菲律宾有权在沙洲上开展建设工作。
“菲律宾并没有占领新的沙洲，因为这些沙洲传统上就是由菲律宾实际控制的，”他说。
亚历哈诺指出，本争议涉及的沙洲距离派格阿萨岛约2.5英里，菲律宾部队和渔民会定期前往巡查与逗留。
“在南海的问题上，杜特地对中国的行动采取的是沉默、顺从、不作为的战略，这一次就是这样，”他说。
杜特地在周三的演讲中强调了菲律宾与中国关系正在回暖。
“我们是中国的朋友，我们是欠他们一份人情的，”他说，指出中国政府曾为菲律宾提供武器，以帮助菲律宾打击菲律宾南部岛屿棉兰老岛马拉维市的激进分子。

The Spratly Islands are abundant in resources and both China and the Philippines, as well as Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, claim to have some or all of their sovereignty. The Chinese government reclaims the sea in the South China Sea to fill the original reefs and exposed rock into a manned permanent outpost. The United States sent warships across the region, aggravating tensions between China and the United States.  
Lorenzana said that Beijing has invoked an agreement between the two foreign ministers, which proposes to maintain the status quo in the region and to no longer occupy new land features so as to ease tensions in the region. He said Duteland learned of this "confrontation" and decided to halt its construction activities in the sandbar.  
Lorenzana said: "I agree with this decision, because it is indeed a new landscape."  
China claims to have almost all its sovereignty over the South China Sea, including some waters that are close to the coasts of other countries.  
One third of the world's maritime traffic passes through the South China Sea, making the dispute a source of conflict. Defense strategists and analysts warn of vying with each other to claim sovereignty or lead to armed conflicts.  
The Philippines has all questioned many of China's claims, but since taking office last year, Dutt has expressed a more moderate attitude. Duteh, now chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hopes to begin negotiations this year with a code of conduct that will govern the actions in the area. Duteland will host the ASEAN leaders' conference in Manila next week.  
However, some members of the Philippines objected, thinking that Dutt was acquiescing to China.  
Gary Alejano, a former Captain of the Marine Corps, warned that China is increasingly active near Ponyo Island and accused Dutet of submitting to China. He also said that the Philippines have the right to use the sandbar Carry out construction work.  
"The Philippines did not occupy new sandbanks because these sandbanks have traditionally been physically controlled by the Philippines," he said.  
Alejandro pointed out that the dispute on the sandbar about 2.5 miles from the island of Pagosa, the Philippine troops and fishermen will regularly visit and stay.  
"On the question of the South China Sea, Dute's strategy of acting toward China is a strategy of silence, obedience, and omission. This is the case this time," he said.  
In a speech Wednesday, Dutert stressed the Philippines are getting warmer with China.  
"We are friends from China and we owe them a lot of human feelings," he said, noting that the Chinese government had provided the Philippines with weapons to help the Philippines fight militants in Malawi, Mindanao, a southern island in the Philippines.
