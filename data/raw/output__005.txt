A.C. Milan is European soccer royalty, its global popularity driven not just by its 18 Italian league championships but also by its seven European titles. Those glories seem long ago these days — the last of Milan’s European Cups was won in 2007 — and now a financial crisis threatens to delay the club’s return to the top even longer.
European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, is concerned about Milan’s financial viability under its Chinese owner, and without a resolution Milan could face sanctions that include a ban from the continental competition it once ruled. Facing mounting concern over its violations of so-called financial fair play rules, created to keep clubs from spending more than they bring in, Milan’s management is trying to persuade regulators that its new Chinese owner, Li Yonghong, is capable of stopping the team’s bleeding millions of euros a year.
Those losses, fueled by more than $270 million in spending to acquire nearly a dozen new players last summer, surpass limits imposed on teams allowed to compete in UEFA’s two main club competitions: the Champions League and the second-tier Europa League.
Two weeks ago, a Milan delegation led by the club’s chief executive, Marco Fassone, and Li’s top deputy at the club, David Han Li, visited UEFA’s lakeside headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, but a four-hour meeting and 160-page presentation outlining a four-year plan and a variety of multiple financial forecasts only produced more questions.
UEFA sent a letter to the club requesting clarification on several matters last Friday, on the same day The New York Times published an article raising doubts about Mr. Li’s financial resources. The Times article reported that phosphate mines Mr. Li claimed as the centerpiece of his business empire appeared to be owned by others.
Milan is in a critical period on and off the field. Despite spending far more than any of its domestic rivals on players last summer, Mr. Li’s first since his purchase, Milan is struggling in seventh place in Italy’s top division, Serie A, and remains 11 points out of the fourth-place position that would grant it access to the glamour and the riches of the Champions League next season.
Even with that income, the club’s ability to break even seems unlikely. Without it, meeting the financial fair play limits would be all but impossible. At the same time, the team is facing a race against time to repay a high-interest, $354 million loan to the hedge fund firm Elliott Management — which financed Mr. Li’s purchase — by next year. Should it default, Elliot would be able to take control of the club.
UEFA will decide Milan’s fate on Dec. 8. Since many new owners take control of troubled clubs, they are allowed some leeway on the financial fair play regulations — provided they can convince UEFA they can bankroll a financial turnaround. Mr. Li’s past financial disputes with regulators and others in China worry UEFA’s inspectors, according to a person familiar with the talks.
Should UEFA reject the request, Milan will face a range of penalties that could include exclusion from the competitions in which it made its name.
UEFA has so far excluded three clubs for financial fair play breaches: Russia’s Dynamo Moscow, Turkey’s Galatasaray and the Hungarian club CSKA Sofia. Other penalties include fines — sometimes in the millions of euros — as well as reductions in squad sizes and bans on registering new players.
An A.C. Milan spokesman said Wednesday that the club’s management remains confident it can reach an agreement with UEFA.
Mr. Li’s $860 million takeover of Milan was the biggest among a number of Chinese buyouts in global soccer in recent years. It also was the most-protracted: Mr. Li missed several deadlines to complete the purchase and had to turn to Elliott at the last moment after potential business partners pulled out.
With the clock ticking on the Elliott loan, Mr. Li is rushing to refinance the debt with a different hedge fund, according to a person familiar with the talks. Italian news media reports said the talks are with HPS Investment Partners, formerly a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. A spokesman for the hedge fund declined to comment.

AC米兰(A.C. Milan)是欧洲的足球权贵，它在全球的号召力不仅是因为18次问鼎意甲联赛冠军，还因为它七夺欧洲冠军。如今，这些荣誉似乎都成了很久以前的事了——米兰最后一次在欧冠联赛上夺冠是在2007年。现在，一场财务危机可能会进一步推迟AC米兰重回巅峰。
欧洲足球管理机构欧洲足球协会联盟（Union of European Football Associations，简称欧足联）担心在中国老板掌控下的米兰的财务能力。如果拿不出解决方案，米兰可能会面临处罚，包括被禁止参加曾经被其统治的欧冠联赛。所谓财务公平竞争规则是用来防止俱乐部入不敷出而制定的，如今有关米兰违反此规定的担忧日渐加剧，其管理层正试图让监管机构相信，来自中国的新老板李勇鸿有能力扭转球队一年亏损数千万欧元的局面。
这些亏损，加上球队去年夏天买入十多名新球员所花的2.7亿美元（约合17.8亿元人民币），超过了参加欧足联两项主要的俱乐部赛事——欧洲冠军联赛(Champions League)和二级赛事欧洲联赛(Europa League)——所需要遵守的限制。
两周前，由俱乐部首席执行官马尔科·法索内(Marco Fassone)和李勇鸿在该俱乐部的首席代理人韩力率领的米兰代表团拜访欧足联设在瑞士尼翁的湖滨总部，但四个小时的会谈和160页的材料演示，包括一个四年计划和各种各样的财务预测，却引发了更多疑问。
上周五，欧足联致函该俱乐部，要求其澄清几件事。同一天，《纽约时报》发表了一篇文章，质疑李勇鸿的资金来源。时报的文章称，被李勇鸿称为其商业帝国核心的磷矿，所有人似乎并不是他。
在足球场上和场下，米兰都处在一个关键时期。尽管去年夏天在球员身上花的钱远超国内其他任何一个竞争对手，米兰在意大利最高赛事甲级联赛中仅名列第七，离第四名的位置还差11分。而只有夺得第四名，球队才有机会在下个赛季争夺冠军联赛的荣誉和财富。
即便有欧冠联赛带来的收入，米兰似乎也不太可能实现收支平衡。如果没有这笔收入，它根本不可能满足财务公平竞争的限制。与此同时，为了在明年之前偿还对冲基金公司埃利奥特管理公司(Elliott Management)的3.54亿美元高利贷，球队正在与时间赛跑。如果球队违约，埃利奥特有权控制俱乐部，而正是该公司为李勇鸿收购米兰提供了资金。
欧足联将于12月8日决定米兰的命运。很多新老板控制的俱乐部都存在问题，因此，只要能让欧足联相信他们能够为扭转财务形势提供资金，他们就能在财务公平竞争规定上获得一定的余地。据一名熟悉商谈情况的人士称，李勇鸿过去在中国与监管机构和其他人的纠纷让欧足联的审查人员感到担忧。
如果欧足联拒绝相关请求，AC米兰将面临一系列处罚，其中可能包括被禁止参加曾令其扬名的各项赛事。
迄今为止，欧足联因违反财务公平竞争规定对三个俱乐部做出了禁赛处罚，分别是俄罗斯的莫斯科迪纳摩(Dynamo Moscow)、土耳其的加拉塔萨雷(Galatasaray)和匈牙利的索菲亚中央陆军(CSKA Sofia)。其他处罚包括可达以百万欧元计的罚款，缩小球队规模，以及禁止引进新球员。
AC米兰发言人于周三称，俱乐部管理层依然相信能够与欧足联达成协议。
在中国近年来收购国际足球俱乐部的若干交易中，李勇鸿以8.6亿美元收购AC米兰是金额最大，也是拖得最久的。李勇鸿多次错过完成收购的最后期限。潜在的生意伙伴退出后，李勇鸿不得不在最后一刻求助于埃利奥特。
据一名了解洽谈情况的人士介绍，随着埃利奥特的贷款即将到期，李勇鸿正急于用这笔债务向另一家对冲基金再融资。意大利的新闻媒体报道说，洽谈的另一方是HPS投资伙伴(HPS Investment Partners)，它曾是摩根大通资产管理公司(J.P. Morgan Asset Management)的子公司。该对冲基金发言人拒绝置评。

AC Milan is Europe's football powerhouse, its global appeal not only because of 18 Serie A titles, but also because it won the European Championship seven. Now, these honors seem to have become a long time ago - the last time Milan won the Champions League in 2007. Now, a financial crisis may further delay AC Milan back to its peak.  
The European soccer governing body Union of European Football Association (UEFA) worries about the financial viability of Milan under the control of Chinese bosses. If no solutions can be taken, Milan may face penalties, including being banned from participating in the Champions League that it once ruled. The so-called financial fair play rules are designed to prevent clubs from making ends meet. Now that concerns about Milan's violation of the rules are growing, management is trying to convince regulators that Li Yonghong, the new boss from China, can reverse the team's loss for one year Tens of millions of euros situation.  
These losses, combined with the $ 270 million (about 1.78 billion yuan) the team spent on buying more than a dozen new players last summer outnumber Champions League's (UEFA) Champions League's two major clubs, UEFA Champions League League and the Europa League - the restrictions to be observed.  
Two weeks ago, a Milan delegation led by club chief executive Marco Fassone and Li Yonghong's chief agent Han Li visited UEFA's Lakefront headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, but four A few hours of talk and 160 pages of material presentations, including a four-year plan and a wide range of financial projections, sparked more questions.  
Last Friday, UEFA sent a letter to the club asking for clarification of a few things. On the same day, The New York Times published an article questioning the source of funding for Yong-Hung Lee. Times article said that by Li Yonghong as its commercial empire phosphate rock, everyone does not seem to be him.  
Milan is at a crucial time on and off the football pitch. Despite spending far more money on players last summer than any other rival in the country, Milan finished seventh in the Serie A Division and 11 points behind the fourth place. Only won the fourth place, the team had the opportunity to compete for the Champions League next season's honor and wealth.  
Even with the Champions League revenue, Milan seems unlikely to break even. Without this income, it simply can not meet the financial fair competition restrictions. Meanwhile, the team is racing against the clock to pay off the $ 354 million loan-sharking hedge fund company Elliott Management by next year. If the team defaults, Elliott has the right to control the club, and it is the company for the acquisition of Milan Li Yonghong funding.  
UEFA will decide on December 8 the fate of Milan. Many new-owner-controlled clubs have problems, so they will have some latitude in the rules of fair financial competition so long as UEFA believes they can finance the reversal of the financial situation. According to a person familiar with the talks, Li Yonghong's past disputes with regulators and others in China have worried UEFA censors.  
If UEFA refuses the request, AC Milan will face a series of penalties, which may include being banned from events that once made it famous.  
To date, Uefa has imposed a ban on three clubs for violating the rules of fair financial competition: Russia's Dynamo Moscow, Galatasaray of Turkey and Central Sofia of Hungary Army (CSKA Sofia). Other penalties include fines in millions of euros, a reduction in the size of the squad, and a ban on the introduction of new players.  
AC Milan spokesman said on Wednesday that club management still believes it can reach an agreement with UEFA.  
In a number of transactions in recent years that China acquired FIFA, Li Yonghong's acquisition of AC Milan at a cost of US $ 860 million was the largest and the most prolonged. Li Yonghong repeatedly missed the deadline to complete the acquisition. After the potential business partners withdrew, Li Yonghong had to turn to Elliott at the last minute.  
According to a person familiar with the negotiations, as Eliot's loan is about to expire, Li Yonghong is eager to refinance another hedge fund with the debt. Italian news media reported that the other party to the negotiation was HPS Investment Partners, a former subsidiary of JP Morgan Asset Management. The hedge fund spokesman declined to comment.
