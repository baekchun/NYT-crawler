HARARE, Zimbabwe — Robert Mugabe, 93, who ruled Zimbabwe with an iron grip until the military placed him under house arrest last week, stunned the nation on Sunday night by refusing to say whether he would resign.
Many political observers and fellow Zimbabweans had been expecting Mr. Mugabe to step down as president after nearly 40 years in power. But the embattled president gave a 20-minute televised speech that acknowledged problems in the nation — and he vowed to soldier on.
“The era of victimization and arbitrary decisions” must end, Mr. Mugabe said while sitting at a table, flanked by members of the military and other officials, including a priest.
He also declared that he would preside over his governing party’s congress in a few weeks. “I will preside over its processes, which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or to compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public,” he said.
Observers questioned how Mr. Mugabe could oversee the congress if he was no longer leader of the party: His address came hours after he was expelled as leader of his party, ZANU-PF, which gave him until noon on Monday to resign or face impeachment by Parliament.
President Robert Mugabe’s own party voted to oust him as its leader on Sunday, a day after thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets to celebrate his stunning fall from power after a military takeover.
The governing ZANU-PF party’s central committee, which held emergency talks at its headquarters in the capital, Harare, to consider the fate of the president who had ruled for 37 years, appointed the previously fired vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as Mr. Mugabe’s successor.
Under the Constitution, Mr. Mugabe remains president, even if in name only. But if he does not resign by noon Monday, the committee members said, he would face impeachment by Parliament.
Cheers and dancing broke out in the building after the vote, according to video shared on social media.
Before the committee’s decision, Chris Mutsvangwa, a war veteran who has led the campaign to oust Mr. Mugabe, said as he went into the meeting, “We are going all the way,” according to Reuters.
He said that Mr. Mugabe should just resign and leave the country: “He’s trying to bargain for a dignified exit but he should just smell the coffee.”
The central committee also expelled the president’s wife, Grace Mugabe, as head of the ZANU-PF Women’s League. Mrs. Mugabe, widely viewed as his likely successor, has not been seen in public since Wednesday.
On Sunday, she was barred from the party for life, along with several other government officials — including Jonathan Moyo, the minister of higher and tertiary education.
The downfall of the 93-year-old autocratic ruler began with a military takeover on Wednesday. Once respected as a liberation icon who went into exile after fighting colonial rule, Mr. Mugabe became isolated from fellow party officials.
Other veterans of the fight for independence from Britain joined the march on Saturday as Zimbabweans poured into the streets and danced, sang and shouted with joy at the prospect of Mr. Mugabe’s rule ending.
After voting to fire Mr. Mugabe as party leader, the party committee took up the matter of impeaching the president.
Innocent Gonese, the parliamentary chief whip from the Movement for Democratic Change — Tsvangirai party, told The A.P. that when Parliament resumed this week, the chamber would “definitely” put in motion a process to impeach Mr. Mugabe.
A majority of the party’s leaders had recommended expelling Mr. Mugabe — a harsh rebuke of the man who had controlled the organization with an iron grip since the country gained independence in 1980.
Mr. Mugabe was also meeting on Sunday for a second round of talks with the army commander Constantino Chiwenga, who placed him under house arrest and said that the action was aimed at rounding up ZANU-PF officials implicated in economic crimes that have ravaged the economy of the southern African nation.
Mr. Mugabe, who has resisted stepping down, was seeking to negotiate a dignified departure, the Zimbabwe state-run broadcaster said.
A Catholic priest, Fidelis Mukonori, was mediating. Others on the negotiating team include the acting intelligence director, Aaron Nhepera, and the Mugabe spokesman George Charamba.
The youth league of Zimbabwe’s ruling party said Mr. Mugabe should resign and take a rest as an “elder statesman,” while his wife should be expelled from the party “forever,” The Associated Press reported.
The league leader, Yeukai Simbanegavi, praised the military on Sunday for moving against what she described as a group of “criminals” led by Mrs. Mugabe, The A.P. said.
“It is unfortunate that the president allowed her to usurp executive authority from him, thereby destroying both the party and the government,” she said.
Elections in Zimbabwe are scheduled for next year, but the political crisis will be on the agenda for a summit meeting in Angola on Tuesday of four countries in the southern African regional bloc: South Africa, which sent envoys to negotiate with Mr. Mugabe on a departure; and Angola, Tanzania and Zambia.

93岁的铁腕领导人罗伯特·穆加贝(Robert Mugabe)统治了津巴布韦数十载，直到上星期被军方软禁。周日晚，穆加贝拒绝透露是否将会辞职，震惊全国。
许多政治观察人士和津巴布韦人都期待穆加贝在执政近40年后卸任。但这位四面楚歌的总统发表了一场20分钟的电视演讲，承认了国家存在的问题——他还承诺要迎头而上。
穆加贝坐在一张桌子旁边说：“欺骗和专断的时代”必须结束，他的两侧是军方成员和其他官员，其中包括一名牧师。
他还宣布将在几周后主持执政党大会。“我将主持它的进程，任何意图破坏它或者在公众眼里将会危及其结果的行为，都不能预先对它施加影响，”他说。
观察人士质疑，如果穆加贝不再是该党的领袖，他如何能够掌管大会：在他的党派“津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线”(ZANU-PF)将其逐出几小时，并要求他在周一中午前辞职，否则就会遭到议会弹劾之后，穆加贝发表了这番演讲。
周日，穆加贝所在的政党投票解除了他作为该党领袖的职务，一天前，数千名津巴布韦人走上街头庆祝军方接管政权，使穆加贝令人震惊地垮台一事。
执政党津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线中央委员会为决定穆加贝的命运，在位于首都哈拉雷的总部举行了紧急会议。委员会任命了之前被解雇的副总统埃默森·穆南加格瓦(Emmerson Mnangagwa)为穆加贝的继任。
按照宪法，穆加贝仍是总统，尽管只是在名义上。但该委员会的成员说，如果穆加贝在周一中午前仍不辞职的话，他将面临议会的弹劾。
传到社交媒体上的视频显示，委员会投票之后，大楼里爆发出欢呼声，人们跳起舞来。
据路透社报道，在该委员会做出决定之前，领导这场让穆加贝下台运动的、参加过抗英战争的老兵克里斯·穆茨万格瓦(Chris Mutsvangwa)在进入会场时表示，“我们将一直走到底。”
他说，穆加贝应该马上辞职并离开该国，“他在试图谈判体面退出的方式，但他早就该清醒清醒了。”
中央委员会也撤销了总统夫人格蕾丝·穆加贝(Grace Mugabe)的非洲民族联盟-爱国阵线妇女联盟负责人的职务。穆加贝夫人曾被外界普遍认为是穆加贝的接班人，她自上周三起一直没有公开露过面。
周日，她和包括高等教育部部长乔纳森·莫约(Jonathan Moyo)在内的其他几位政府官员也被永久开除党籍。
军方在上周三接管了政府，引发了这位93岁的独裁统治者的垮台。穆加贝曾被视为非洲解放的偶像，在反抗殖民统治期间曾流亡国外，后来他变得与党内其他官员格格不入。
其他曾参加过从英国争取独立斗争的老兵也加入到周六游行的行列，当天有许多津巴布韦人涌上街头，他们跳着舞、唱着歌，为穆加贝的统治即将结束的前景欢呼雀跃。
在投票决定解除穆加贝的党领导人职务之后，该委员会开始讨论弹劾总统的问题。
来自“争取民主变革运动”党（简称民革运）茨万吉拉伊派的议会首席组织秘书伊诺森特·戈奈斯(Innocent Gonese)在接受美联社采访时表示，议会本周复会时，“肯定”会启动弹劾穆加贝的程序。
津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线的大多数领导人都建议将穆加贝开除出党，这是对自1980年该国获得独立以来就一直控制着这个政党的铁腕人物的严厉谴责。
周日，穆加贝与国防军司令康斯坦丁诺·奇温加(Constantino Chiwenga)进行了第二轮会谈，奇温加已将穆加贝软禁起来，并表示军方行动是为了对执政党中涉嫌经济犯罪的官员采取控制措施，这种犯罪已摧毁了这个南部非洲国家的经济。
据津巴布韦国家广播电台说，穆加贝一直拒绝辞职，他正在寻求谈判，以得到一个有尊严的退出方式。
谈判由天主教神父菲德里斯·穆科诺里(Fidelis Mukonori)调停。参加谈判的其他人包括代理情报局长亚伦·奈佩拉(Aaron Nhepera)和穆加贝的发言人乔治·查拉姆巴(George Charamba)。
据美联社报道，津巴布韦执政党下属的青年联盟表示，穆加贝应该辞职，并以“年长政治家”的身份隐退，但他的妻子应该被“永远”开除出党。
美联社称，青年联盟领导人约卡伊·辛姆巴内戈维(Yeukai Simbanegavi)周日对军方的行动表示赞扬，说行动拿下了被她描述为以穆加贝夫人为首的一群“罪犯”。
“总统允许她篡夺了自己的行政权力，从而摧毁了执政党和政府，这令人遗憾，”辛姆巴内戈维说。
津巴布韦定于在明年举行选举，但该国的政治危机将出现在周二在安哥拉举行的南部非洲区域四国首脑会议的议程上。这四个国家是南非，该国已派遣特使与穆加贝谈判离开津巴布韦的事情，以及安哥拉、坦桑尼亚和赞比亚。

The eldest 93-year-old leader Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for decades before he was put under house arrest by the military last week. On Sunday night, Mugabe declined to say whether he would resign and shocked the entire country.  
Many political observers and Zimbabweans expect Mugabe to step down after nearly 40 years in office. But the beleaguered president delivered a 20-minute television speech recognizing the country's problems - and he promised to head up.  
Mugabe sat at a table and said: "The era of deception and dictation" must end with members of the military and other officials on both sides, including a priest.  
He also announced that he will preside over the ruling party in a few weeks. "I will preside over its course and any attempt to destroy it or to jeopardize its outcome in the eyes of the public can not prejudice it," he said.  
Observers questioned how he could rule the General Assembly if Mugabe was no longer the leader of the party: he was expelled for several hours by his party ZANU-PF and asked him Mugabe made his speech after resigning before noon on Monday, otherwise he would be impeached by the parliament.  
On Sunday, Mugabe's political party voted to lift his position as leader of the party, a day after thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets to celebrate the military takeover of the regime and Mugabe's shock collapse.  
Ruling Zimbabwe African National Alliance - RPF Central Committee In order to determine the fate of Mugabe, an emergency meeting was held at the headquarters in the capital, Harare. The commission appointed previously dismissed Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe.  
According to the constitution, Mugabe remains president, albeit in nominally. But members of the committee say he will face a parliamentary impeachment if Mugabe does not resign by noon Monday.  
Videos posted on social media show that after the committee voted, cheers erupted in the building and people danced.  
According to a Reuters report, Chris Mutsvangwa, the veteran of the Anti- British War who led Mugabe's step-down campaign before entering the venue, said before the committee's decision: We will go all the way. "  
He said Mugabe should immediately resign and leave the country. "He is trying to negotiate a decent exit, but he must have been sober-minded."  
The Central Committee also rescinded the head of the Presidential Lady Grace Mugabe, the African National Union, the leader of the Women's Union of the Patriotic Front. Mrs Mugabe has been widely recognized as the successor to Mugabe, who has not been seen publicly since last Wednesday.  
On Sunday, she and several other government officials, including Minister of Higher Education Jonathan Moyo, were also permanently expelled from the party.  
The military took over the government last Wednesday, triggering the collapse of the 93-year-old authoritarian ruler. Mugabe, once regarded as an icon of the liberation of Africa, was exiled to foreign countries during the anti- colonial rule and later became incompatible with other officials in the party.  
Other veterans who had participated in the fight for independence from Britain also joined the ranks of Saturday marches, many of whom were on the streets that day, dancing and singing songs, cheering for the prospect of the end of rule by Mugabe.  
After voting on the decision to lift Mugabe's party leader, the commission began to discuss the impeachment of the president.  
In an interview with the Associated Press, Innocent Gonese, secretary of parliamentary organization from the "Movement for Democracy and Transformation Movement" (PKK), Tsvangirai, said that when the parliament resumed its meeting this week, "Sure" will start the process of impeaching Mugabe.  
Most leaders of the African National Alliance for Zimbabwe, the leader of the RPF, have proposed to expel Mugabe from the party. This is a harsh condemnation of the iron-man who has been in control of this party since the country gained independence in 1980.  
On Sunday, Mugabe held his second round of talks with Defense Force Commander Constantino Chiwenga, who has put him under house arrest and said the military action was aimed at cracking down on the ruling party Control measures were taken by officials suspected of economic crimes, a crime that has destroyed the economy of this southern African country.  
According to Zimbabwe's National Radio, Mugabe has been refusing to resign, and he is seeking to negotiate a dignified exit.  
Negotiations were mediated by the Catholic priest Fidelis Mukonori. Others involved in the negotiations included acting intelligence chief Aaron Nhepera and Mugabe spokesman George Charamba.  
According to the Associated Press, the youth coalition affiliated with the Zimbabwe ruling party said Mugabe should resign and be allowed to retire as an "elderly politician," but his wife should be expelled from the party "forever."  
The Associated Press says Yeukai Simbanegavi, the leader of the YMCA, praised the military on Sunday, saying it had captured what she described as a group headed by Mrs. Mugabe "criminal".  
"It is regrettable that the president allowed her to usurp the administrative power of her and thus destroy the ruling party and government," Simbarnegovi said.  
Zimbabwe is scheduled to hold the election next year, but the political crisis in the country will take place on the agenda of the four-nation summit in southern Africa, held in Angola on Tuesday. The four countries are South Africa, which has sent its special envoy to negotiate the departure of Zimbabwe from Mugabe, as well as Angola, Tanzania and Zambia.
