MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has ordered military officials to stop construction work on a sandbar in a disputed area of the South China Sea after Beijing complained, the country’s defense chief said Wednesday.
菲律宾马尼拉——菲律宾国防部高官周三表示，在中国提出抗议后，总统罗德里戈·杜特地(Rodrigo Duterte)已命令军方停止在南海争议地区一处沙洲上的建设工作。
China complained in August about the work on the sandbar at Sandy Cay, the Philippine defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, said.
菲律宾国防部长德芬·洛伦扎纳(Delfin Lorenzana)说，今年8月，中国曾对菲律宾在敦谦沙洲(Sandy Cay)的活动提出抗议。
The sandbar is near Thitu Island, which Manila calls Pag-Asa island and claims as its own.
沙洲位于中业岛附近，菲律宾称之为“派格阿萨岛”(Pag-Asa)，并将其视为本国领土。
“They complained that we were occupying a new feature,” Lorenzana said, adding that the Philippine Defense Ministry had transported people there “to put structures for our fishermen.”
并补充说菲律宾国防部曾派人前往那里“为渔民搭建房屋”。
The resource-rich Spratly Islands are claimed in whole or in part by both nations, as well as by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
斯普拉特利群岛（Spratly Islands，中国称南沙群岛 ——译注）资源丰富，中菲双方以及文莱、马来西亚、台湾和越南都宣称对其拥有部分或全部主权。
Beijing has been creating artificial islands in the South China Sea, expanding former reefs and outcrops into guarded permanent outposts, increasing tensions with Washington, which has sent warships through the area.
中国政府在南海填海造岛，将原有的礁石和外露的岩石填埋成有人驻守的永久性前哨。
Lorenzana said that Beijing had invoked an agreement between the Chinese and Philippine foreign ministers to maintain the status quo in the area, and not to occupy any new land features, in an effort to reduce tensions in the area.
洛伦扎纳说，北京方面援引了两国外长之间的一项协议，该协议提出维持该地区现状，不再占领新的自然地貌(land feature)，从而缓解该地区紧张局势。
He said that Duterte had been informed of the “standoff” and had decided to halt construction on the sandbar.
他表示，杜特地得知这一“对峙”，决定叫停本国在沙洲的建设活动。洛伦扎纳说：“我同意这个决定，因为这确实是一个新地貌。”
“I agree with the decision because it was indeed a new feature,” Lorenzana said.

曾是一名海军陆战队上尉的加里·亚历哈诺(Gary Alejano)议员警告，中国在中业岛附近的活动日益频繁，并指责杜特地向中国屈服，还表示，菲律宾有权在沙洲上开展建设工作。
“There was no new occupation of the sandbars by the Philippines because these sandbars have been traditionally under effective control by Philippine troops,” he said.
“菲律宾并没有占领新的沙洲，因为这些沙洲传统上就是由菲律宾实际控制的，”他说。
Alejano noted that the sandbars in question, about 2.5 miles from Pag-Asa, were subject to regular patrols and visits by Philippine forces and fishermen.
亚历哈诺指出，本争议涉及的沙洲距离派格阿萨岛约2.5英里，菲律宾部队和渔民会定期前往巡查与逗留。“在南海的问题上，杜特地对中国的行动采取的是沉默、顺从、不作为的战略，这一次就是这样，”他说。
“That is part of Duterte’s strategy of silence, inaction and subservience to China’s actions in the South China Sea,” he said.
