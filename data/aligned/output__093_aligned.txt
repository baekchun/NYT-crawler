WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States needed “a good ‘shutdown'” this fall to force a partisan confrontation over federal spending, and suggested that he might move to reverse long-standing Senate rules that effectively require a supermajority to approve most major pieces of legislation.
华盛顿——唐纳德·特朗普总统周二表示，美国需要在今年秋天“好好‘停摆’一次”，以解决就联邦支出形成的党派对抗，还暗示他可能会推翻一项长期存在的参议院规则，即要求取得绝对多数票才能通过大多数重要的议案。
The declarations, in a pair of posts on Twitter, appeared aimed at defending a spending package that Congress is likely to clear this week, but that fails to accomplish many of Trump’s stated goals, including any money to build a wall on the southern border that was his most talked-about campaign promise.
这次表态是以两条推文的形式发出的，似乎是为一项开支计划辩护，国会本周有可能批准该计划，但它没能达成特朗普的许多既定目标，包括拨款在美国南部边境修建一道墙，即他谈论最多的竞选承诺。
Conservative activists have decried the agreement as one that does not address their priorities, but the White House has signaled that the president will accept it rather than set off a government shutdown.
保守派活动人士公开谴责这项协议，称它没有解决他们的优先事项，但白宫已经释放信号，表示总统将接受它，而非开启一轮政府停摆。
The Twitter messages were also an indication of the degree to which bipartisan negotiations in Congress on the spending bill and others, including a health care overhaul that appeared on Tuesday to be stalled yet again, have bedeviled Trump at this early stage of his presidency, forcing him to bow to political realities to which he had insisted he was immune.
那两条推文也显示出，国会内部就这项开支计划及其他问题——包括一项周二提出但又一次陷入停滞的医保修订方案——展开的党派协商，在特朗普就任总统初期便给他带来的困扰程度，令他不得不向他此前坚称自己不会受其影响的政治现实低头。
“The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!” Trump said in one post, an apparent reference to the spending package.
“共和党和民主党之所以就这项计划进行谈判，是我们需要在参议院获得60票，而我们没能拿到那么多支持票！”
