SEOUL, South Korea — When foreign correspondents cover dangerous situations, they often depend on local assistants, who in many cases take greater risks than they do.
韩国首尔——外国记者对危险情况进行报道时，往往要靠本地人的帮助，在很多情况下，助手承担的风险比记者承担的还要大。
In the bloody month of May 1980 in Gwangju, South Korea, one such invisible hero was a taxi driver whose name may or may not have been Kim Sa-bok.

A film, “A Taxi Driver,” opened Wednesday in theaters across the country, telling the story of the uprising from the point of view of a fictionalized version of Mr. Kim — who, despite the efforts of Mr. Hinzpeter and others over the years, has never been identified.
一部名为《出租车司机》(A Taxi Driver)的电影周三在韩国各地的影院上映，影片从虚构人物金世福的角度讲述了光州民主化运动的故事，尽管欣茨佩特和其他人做了多年的努力，但人们仍不知道这个司机是谁。“在这之前，我从未在关于欣茨佩特的伟大故事里听到过还有一名出租车司机，”高中生金柱圣（Kim Ju-sung，音）最近观看了电影的预映之后说。
