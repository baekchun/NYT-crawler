HARARE, Zimbabwe — Robert Mugabe, 93, who ruled Zimbabwe with an iron grip until the military placed him under house arrest last week, stunned the nation on Sunday night by refusing to say whether he would resign.
93岁的铁腕领导人罗伯特·穆加贝(Robert Mugabe)统治了津巴布韦数十载，直到上星期被军方软禁。
Many political observers and fellow Zimbabweans had been expecting Mr. Mugabe to step down as president after nearly 40 years in power.
许多政治观察人士和津巴布韦人都期待穆加贝在执政近40年后卸任。
But the embattled president gave a 20-minute televised speech that acknowledged problems in the nation — and he vowed to soldier on.
但这位四面楚歌的总统发表了一场20分钟的电视演讲，承认了国家存在的问题——他还承诺要迎头而上。
“The era of victimization and arbitrary decisions” must end, Mr. Mugabe said while sitting at a table, flanked by members of the military and other officials, including a priest.
穆加贝坐在一张桌子旁边说：“欺骗和专断的时代”必须结束，他的两侧是军方成员和其他官员，其中包括一名牧师。
He also declared that he would preside over his governing party’s congress in a few weeks.
他还宣布将在几周后主持执政党大会。
“I will preside over its processes, which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or to compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public,” he said.
“我将主持它的进程，任何意图破坏它或者在公众眼里将会危及其结果的行为，都不能预先对它施加影响，”他说。观察人士质疑，如果穆加贝不再是该党的领袖，他如何能够掌管大会：在他的党派“津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线”(ZANU-PF)将其逐出几小时，并要求他在周一中午前辞职，否则就会遭到议会弹劾之后，穆加贝发表了这番演讲。
Observers questioned how Mr. Mugabe could oversee the congress if he was no longer leader of the party: His address came hours after he was expelled as leader of his party, ZANU-PF, which gave him until noon on Monday to resign or face impeachment by Parliament.
观察人士质疑，如果穆加贝不再是该党的领袖，他如何能够掌管大会：在他的党派“津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线”(ZANU-PF)将其逐出几小时，并要求他在周一中午前辞职，否则就会遭到议会弹劾之后，穆加贝发表了这番演讲。
President Robert Mugabe’s own party voted to oust him as its leader on Sunday, a day after thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets to celebrate his stunning fall from power after a military takeover.
周日，穆加贝所在的政党投票解除了他作为该党领袖的职务，一天前，数千名津巴布韦人走上街头庆祝军方接管政权，使穆加贝令人震惊地垮台一事。
The governing ZANU-PF party’s central committee, which held emergency talks at its headquarters in the capital, Harare, to consider the fate of the president who had ruled for 37 years, appointed the previously fired vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as Mr. Mugabe’s successor.
执政党津巴布韦非洲民族联盟—爱国阵线中央委员会为决定穆加贝的命运，在位于首都哈拉雷的总部举行了紧急会议。委员会任命了之前被解雇的副总统埃默森·穆南加格瓦(Emmerson Mnangagwa)为穆加贝的继任。
Under the Constitution, Mr. Mugabe remains president, even if in name only.
按照宪法，穆加贝仍是总统，尽管只是在名义上。
But if he does not resign by noon Monday, the committee members said, he would face impeachment by Parliament.
但该委员会的成员说，如果穆加贝在周一中午前仍不辞职的话，他将面临议会的弹劾。
Cheers and dancing broke out in the building after the vote, according to video shared on social media.

Before the committee’s decision, Chris Mutsvangwa, a war veteran who has led the campaign to oust Mr. Mugabe, said as he went into the meeting, “We are going all the way,” according to Reuters.
据路透社报道，在该委员会做出决定之前，领导这场让穆加贝下台运动的、参加过抗英战争的老兵克里斯·穆茨万格瓦(Chris Mutsvangwa)在进入会场时表示，“我们将一直走到底。”
He said that Mr. Mugabe should just resign and leave the country: “He’s trying to bargain for a dignified exit but he should just smell the coffee.”
他说，穆加贝应该马上辞职并离开该国，“他在试图谈判体面退出的方式，但他早就该清醒清醒了。”
The central committee also expelled the president’s wife, Grace Mugabe, as head of the ZANU-PF Women’s League.
中央委员会也撤销了总统夫人格蕾丝·穆加贝(Grace Mugabe)的非洲民族联盟-爱国阵线妇女联盟负责人的职务。
Mrs. Mugabe, widely viewed as his likely successor, has not been seen in public since Wednesday.
穆加贝夫人曾被外界普遍认为是穆加贝的接班人，她自上周三起一直没有公开露过面。
On Sunday, she was barred from the party for life, along with several other government officials — including Jonathan Moyo, the minister of higher and tertiary education.
周日，她和包括高等教育部部长乔纳森·莫约(Jonathan Moyo)在内的其他几位政府官员也被永久开除党籍。
The downfall of the 93-year-old autocratic ruler began with a military takeover on Wednesday.

Once respected as a liberation icon who went into exile after fighting colonial rule, Mr. Mugabe became isolated from fellow party officials.

A majority of the party’s leaders had recommended expelling Mr. Mugabe — a harsh rebuke of the man who had controlled the organization with an iron grip since the country gained independence in 1980.
