A.C. Milan is European soccer royalty, its global popularity driven not just by its 18 Italian league championships but also by its seven European titles.
AC米兰(A.C. Milan)是欧洲的足球权贵，它在全球的号召力不仅是因为18次问鼎意甲联赛冠军，还因为它七夺欧洲冠军。
Those glories seem long ago these days — the last of Milan’s European Cups was won in 2007 — and now a financial crisis threatens to delay the club’s return to the top even longer.
如今，这些荣誉似乎都成了很久以前的事了——米兰最后一次在欧冠联赛上夺冠是在2007年。现在，一场财务危机可能会进一步推迟AC米兰重回巅峰。
European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, is concerned about Milan’s financial viability under its Chinese owner, and without a resolution Milan could face sanctions that include a ban from the continental competition it once ruled.
欧洲足球管理机构欧洲足球协会联盟（Union of European Football Associations，简称欧足联）担心在中国老板掌控下的米兰的财务能力。
Facing mounting concern over its violations of so-called financial fair play rules, created to keep clubs from spending more than they bring in, Milan’s management is trying to persuade regulators that its new Chinese owner, Li Yonghong, is capable of stopping the team’s bleeding millions of euros a year.
所谓财务公平竞争规则是用来防止俱乐部入不敷出而制定的，如今有关米兰违反此规定的担忧日渐加剧，其管理层正试图让监管机构相信，来自中国的新老板李勇鸿有能力扭转球队一年亏损数千万欧元的局面。
Those losses, fueled by more than $270 million in spending to acquire nearly a dozen new players last summer, surpass limits imposed on teams allowed to compete in UEFA’s two main club competitions: the Champions League and the second-tier Europa League.
这些亏损，加上球队去年夏天买入十多名新球员所花的2.7亿美元（约合17.8亿元人民币），超过了参加欧足联两项主要的俱乐部赛事——欧洲冠军联赛(Champions League)和二级赛事欧洲联赛(Europa League)——所需要遵守的限制。
Two weeks ago, a Milan delegation led by the club’s chief executive, Marco Fassone, and Li’s top deputy at the club, David Han Li, visited UEFA’s lakeside headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, but a four-hour meeting and 160-page presentation outlining a four-year plan and a variety of multiple financial forecasts only produced more questions.
两周前，由俱乐部首席执行官马尔科·法索内(Marco Fassone)和李勇鸿在该俱乐部的首席代理人韩力率领的米兰代表团拜访欧足联设在瑞士尼翁的湖滨总部，但四个小时的会谈和160页的材料演示，包括一个四年计划和各种各样的财务预测，却引发了更多疑问。
UEFA sent a letter to the club requesting clarification on several matters last Friday, on the same day The New York Times published an article raising doubts about Mr. Li’s financial resources.
上周五，欧足联致函该俱乐部，要求其澄清几件事。
The Times article reported that phosphate mines Mr. Li claimed as the centerpiece of his business empire appeared to be owned by others.
时报的文章称，被李勇鸿称为其商业帝国核心的磷矿，所有人似乎并不是他。
Milan is in a critical period on and off the field.
在足球场上和场下，米兰都处在一个关键时期。
Despite spending far more than any of its domestic rivals on players last summer, Mr. Li’s first since his purchase, Milan is struggling in seventh place in Italy’s top division, Serie A, and remains 11 points out of the fourth-place position that would grant it access to the glamour and the riches of the Champions League next season.
尽管去年夏天在球员身上花的钱远超国内其他任何一个竞争对手，米兰在意大利最高赛事甲级联赛中仅名列第七，离第四名的位置还差11分。
Even with that income, the club’s ability to break even seems unlikely.
即便有欧冠联赛带来的收入，米兰似乎也不太可能实现收支平衡。如果没有这笔收入，它根本不可能满足财务公平竞争的限制。
Without it, meeting the financial fair play limits would be all but impossible.
如果没有这笔收入，它根本不可能满足财务公平竞争的限制。
At the same time, the team is facing a race against time to repay a high-interest, $354 million loan to the hedge fund firm Elliott Management — which financed Mr. Li’s purchase — by next year.
与此同时，为了在明年之前偿还对冲基金公司埃利奥特管理公司(Elliott Management)的3.54亿美元高利贷，球队正在与时间赛跑。
Should it default, Elliot would be able to take control of the club.
如果球队违约，埃利奥特有权控制俱乐部，而正是该公司为李勇鸿收购米兰提供了资金。
UEFA will decide Milan’s fate on Dec. 8.
欧足联将于12月8日决定米兰的命运。
Since many new owners take control of troubled clubs, they are allowed some leeway on the financial fair play regulations — provided they can convince UEFA they can bankroll a financial turnaround.
很多新老板控制的俱乐部都存在问题，因此，只要能让欧足联相信他们能够为扭转财务形势提供资金，他们就能在财务公平竞争规定上获得一定的余地。
Mr. Li’s past financial disputes with regulators and others in China worry UEFA’s inspectors, according to a person familiar with the talks.
据一名熟悉商谈情况的人士称，李勇鸿过去在中国与监管机构和其他人的纠纷让欧足联的审查人员感到担忧。
Should UEFA reject the request, Milan will face a range of penalties that could include exclusion from the competitions in which it made its name.
如果欧足联拒绝相关请求，AC米兰将面临一系列处罚，其中可能包括被禁止参加曾令其扬名的各项赛事。
UEFA has so far excluded three clubs for financial fair play breaches: Russia’s Dynamo Moscow, Turkey’s Galatasaray and the Hungarian club CSKA Sofia.
迄今为止，欧足联因违反财务公平竞争规定对三个俱乐部做出了禁赛处罚，分别是俄罗斯的莫斯科迪纳摩(Dynamo Moscow)、土耳其的加拉塔萨雷(Galatasaray)和匈牙利的索菲亚中央陆军(CSKA Sofia)。
Other penalties include fines — sometimes in the millions of euros — as well as reductions in squad sizes and bans on registering new players.
其他处罚包括可达以百万欧元计的罚款，缩小球队规模，以及禁止引进新球员。
An A.C. Milan spokesman said Wednesday that the club’s management remains confident it can reach an agreement with UEFA.
AC米兰发言人于周三称，俱乐部管理层依然相信能够与欧足联达成协议。
Mr. Li’s $860 million takeover of Milan was the biggest among a number of Chinese buyouts in global soccer in recent years.
在中国近年来收购国际足球俱乐部的若干交易中，李勇鸿以8.6亿美元收购AC米兰是金额最大，也是拖得最久的。
It also was the most-protracted: Mr. Li missed several deadlines to complete the purchase and had to turn to Elliott at the last moment after potential business partners pulled out.
潜在的生意伙伴退出后，李勇鸿不得不在最后一刻求助于埃利奥特。
With the clock ticking on the Elliott loan, Mr. Li is rushing to refinance the debt with a different hedge fund, according to a person familiar with the talks.
据一名了解洽谈情况的人士介绍，随着埃利奥特的贷款即将到期，李勇鸿正急于用这笔债务向另一家对冲基金再融资。
Italian news media reports said the talks are with HPS Investment Partners, formerly a subsidiary of J.P.
意大利的新闻媒体报道说，洽谈的另一方是HPS投资伙伴(HPS Investment Partners)，它曾是摩根大通资产管理公司(J.P. Morgan Asset Management)的子公司。
Morgan Asset Management.
意大利的新闻媒体报道说，洽谈的另一方是HPS投资伙伴(HPS Investment Partners)，它曾是摩根大通资产管理公司(J.P. Morgan Asset Management)的子公司。
A spokesman for the hedge fund declined to comment.
该对冲基金发言人拒绝置评。
