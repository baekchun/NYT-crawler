Steven Spielberg, an enthusiastic donor to Clinton who had the use of a pied-à-terre in Trump Tower purchased for him by Universal Pictures, barely stayed at the place, despite its views of Central Park,and offered it to the candidate as a crash pad on grueling campaign days.
史蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格(Steven Spielberg)是克林顿的热心捐助者，他在特朗普大厦拥有一套临时住所，是环球影业为他买下的，尽管这里能看到中央公园的风景，他却几乎从没住过，他邀请克林顿住在这里，让她在精疲力尽的竞选过程中有个歇脚的地方。

这幢大楼有58层，但这并没有阻止开发商将其宣传为68层的大厦，这令首席建筑师德尔·斯卡特(Der Scutt)感到懊恼。下面19层是商用部分，第一个住宅层，也就是第20层，被称为第30层。

The completion of a grand tower in Midtown’s high-end retail district cemented Trump’s status as a force to be reckoned with in New York while also setting him apart from his father, the developer Fred C. Trump, who made his fortune with an empire of middle-class housing units in boroughs outside Manhattan.
在中城高端零售区建成一座宏伟的大厦，巩固了特朗普的地位，使他成为被纽约市认可的一股势力，同时也将他与父亲、开发商弗雷德·C·特朗普(Fred C. Trump)区分开，后者通过在曼哈顿以外的区建造了一个中产阶级住房帝国而获得巨额财富。“能摆脱父亲影响的儿子是不多的，”唐纳德·特朗普1983年接受《纽约时报》采访时说。

特朗普给审理该案的法官写了一封信，为韦克塞尔鲍姆求情，称他是“社区的荣耀”，韦克塞尔鲍姆不久后认罪，被判三年监禁。

Since Trump’s political career took off, there have been questions about his possible ties to Russia.

But in 2002, the Bayrock Group, a real estate investment fund run by two Russian-born entrepreneurs, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater, moved into office space on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, where they began work on the future Trump SoHo and used their connections to explore a possible Trump building in Moscow.

Trump has repeatedly tried to play down his involvement with Sater.
据前司法部长洛蕾塔·林奇(Loretta Lynch)称，萨塔尔后来做了政府的线人，被免于入狱，他提供了关于各种国际犯罪集团的关键情报。

2007年，他在接受时报采访时表示，他“不太认识（萨塔尔）”。2015年，他向美联社(The Associated Press)的一名记者表示，他跟萨塔尔“不熟”。
