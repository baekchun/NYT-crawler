Also take note: The light from the blast can damage your eyes.
还要注意：爆炸的亮光会刺伤你的眼睛。
But why now?
但是为什么现在发布呢？
Rising tensions with North Korea have put the possibility of a total wipeout on the radar of the archipelago’s population of more than 1.4 million.
与朝鲜越来越紧张的关系使得夏威夷群岛的140多万人口有可能被从雷达上完全抹去。
On July 5, the United States toughened its military pressure and invective against the Communist nation after North Korea conducted a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of hitting America’s two most western states: Alaska and Hawaii.
7月5日，在朝鲜成功地进行了一次洲际弹道导弹试验之后——该导弹似乎能够打击美国最西部的两个州：阿拉斯加和夏威夷——美国加强了对这个共产主义国家的军事压力和抨击。
The United States described the test as a “dangerous escalation” in what has become a crisis for the Trump administration.

Late on Monday, the state’s governor, David Ige, held his office’s first Facebook Live session.
周一晚些时候，夏威夷州长戴维·伊盖(David Ige)主持了他的办公室的第一次Facebook现场会议。
The event was a decidedly casual affair, with officials in print shirts and big smiles.
这场活动的气氛显然很随意，官员们穿着印花衬衫，笑容满面。
There were apologies for the slow Wi-Fi, and staff members waved into the camera or reached over Governor Ige’s shoulder to fiddle with the transmission feed as thousands watched.
他们为Wi-Fi速度慢道了歉，工作人员对着摄像机挥手或越过州长伊盖的肩膀调试传送画面。
“Today’s topic really is about emergency management and emergency preparedness, including the conversation of the week, which is really about North Korea,” said Governor Ige, though he said any threat was “unlikely.”
“今天的话题其实是关于应急管理和应急准备，包括本周的会谈，其实是关于朝鲜的，”州长伊盖说。
After a few minutes of pleasantries and information about hurricane season in the Pacific, the governor and his co-host, Vern Miyagi, the emergency management agency administrator, paused to scrutinize the scroll on the screen for their first audience query.
州长和他的搭档主持、紧急措施署署长弗恩·米亚希(Vern Miyagi)先是寒暄了几分钟，谈论了太平洋飓风季的信息，然后停下来仔细查看屏幕上的第一个观众提问。
“We have a question,” said Governor Ige, apparently new to this.
“我们收到了一个问题，”州长伊盖说，他显然是这方面的新手。
“If North Korea sends a bomb, do we have a bomb to send back?” he read.
“如果朝鲜发来一枚炸弹，我们有没有炸弹发回去？”
The two men chuckled, nervously, it appeared.

“That’s a very, very good question,” said Mr. Miyagi.
“这是个非常、非常好的问题，”米亚希说。
“My job right now — I am not in the military,” he said, adding, “I would defer to the active-duty military on that question.”
“这是个非常、非常好的问题，”米亚希说。“我现在的任务——我不是军方的人，”他接着说，“在这个问题上，我会交给现役军人来回答。”
Governor Ige jumped in, referring to his recent conversations with Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr. at the U.S. Pacific Command headquarters on Oahu.
州长伊盖插话进来，提到他前不久在瓦胡岛的美国太平洋司令部与海军上将小哈里·B·哈里斯(Adm. Harry B.Harris Jr.)的会谈。
“As you know, we are working with the Department of Defense to assure the defense of Hawaii in general,” he said.
“你知道，我们正在与国防部合作，确保夏威夷总体的防卫，”他说。
“There are definitely a lot of conversations.
“我们肯定进行了很多谈话。我们在评估夏威夷的具体防务形势，你知道，夏威夷有很多资产是国防部很想保护的。”
We are assessing the specific defense posture of Hawaii, and as you know, there are many assets here in Hawaii that the D.O.D is interested in protecting.

“The possibility of a missile or bomb from North Korea is very, very low,” he added.
“朝鲜发射导弹或炸弹的可能性很低，”他还说。“那是很不可能发生的事情。
“It is a very unlikely event.
“那是很不可能发生的事情。
Our whole focus is to make sure that we are prepared.”

Officials have been working on the ideas and new guidelines since late last year, after multiple missile tests in North Korea but before this month’s successful firing.
官员们从去年年底起开始思考新方法和指导原则，也就是在朝鲜进行数次导弹试验之后，在本月成功发射之前。
New measures include nuclear drills in public schools, which start on August 7.

After hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes and heavy flooding, a missile threat from North Korea does not rank high.

“It is very low compared to the potential threat from a hurricane,” Lt.
“与飓风的潜在威胁相比，它的威胁程度很低，”夏威夷防务部发言人查尔斯·安东尼中校(Charles Anthony)在接受电话采访时表示。

2009年，奥巴马政府宣布朝鲜能够向夏威夷发射弹道导弹时，美国军方就加强了那里的防务。
Charles Anthony, a spokesman for the state defense department, said in a telephone interview.
国防部表示，反导拦截装置已经就位，夏威夷人有幸能看到一个通常被称为高尔夫球的巨大雷达从基地冲到海上的盛况。
“But we still have to prepare for all hazards.”
米亚希表示，民防官员正努力在全州各岛上部署一个协同计划。
In 2009, when the Obama administration announced that North Korea could launch a ballistic missile in Hawaii’s direction, the United States military strengthened defenses there.

But the two officials repeatedly said that any nuclear event was unlikely, adding that the new public safety campaign was enacted out of an abundance of caution.
不过这两名官员多次表示，核爆的可能性很小。他们还说，新的公共安全宣传是因为收到多次警告才进行的。
“I have been asked, ‘Why now?’ It’s just that they have been testing and testing and testing,” said Mr. Miyagi, speaking of North Korea, which is about 5,000 miles away.
’就是因为他们在不停地试验，”米亚希说。
“Although the chances of this happening is remote, the probability is very low and unlikely, we just have to get ahead of it and answer the question — what is Hawaii doing?” Mr. Miyagi said.
“虽然这发生的可能性很小，但我们必须提前回答这个问题——夏威夷在做什么？”
“The threat is low.

Hawaii is safe.”

周二，《夏威夷先驱论坛报》(The Hawaii Tribune Herald)报道称，夏威夷是第一个为应对朝鲜核打击而进行应急宣传的州。
