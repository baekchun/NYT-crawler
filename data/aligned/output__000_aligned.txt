The new legislation, modeled on American laws that ban foreign campaign donations and require registration of foreign agents, had been widely expected after a drumbeat of stories in the Australian news media about the perceived threat of Chinese interference.
澳大利亚新闻媒体对被视为中国干预的威胁进行了大量报道之后，人们普遍预料将有新立法，新立法的摹本是美国的有关法律，美国已经禁止外国为竞选活动提供捐款，并要求为外国当代理的人登记注册。
It was not the legislation that the Chinese statement directly condemned, but rather the media accounts that prompted it, as well as the public debate around the issue.
中国的声明并没有直接谴责这项立法，而是谴责了导致这项立法的媒体报道和围绕着有关问题展开的公开辩论。
Both have zeroed in on China as a threat, accusing the country of trying to exert influence through political donations and pressure applied to Chinese students at Australian universities.
那些报道和辩论都把注意力集中在中国威胁上，指责中国试图通过政治捐款、以及向在澳中国留学生施加压力来行使中国的影响力。
“We categorically reject those allegations,” the embassy said in its statement, adding: “China has no intention to interfere in Australia’s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations.
“我们坚决拒绝”这些指责，大使馆在声明中说。声明还说：“中方无意干涉澳内政，也无意通过政治献金影响澳政治进程。
We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner.”
我们敦促澳方以客观公正理性的态度看待中国，看待中澳关系。”
The statement pointed to strong discontent from China’s leaders in Beijing, and it amounted to a warning for Australian politicians against continuing to portray China as an enemy.
大使馆的声明明确表示了中国领导人的强烈不满，基本上是在警告澳大利亚政客不要继续视中国为敌。但专家表示，这种声明可能只会加剧人们对中国影响的担忧，进一步损害中国在澳大利亚已经受损的形象。
But experts said the statement might only heighten concerns about China’s influence and damage its already tarnished image in Australia.
但专家表示，这种声明可能只会加剧人们对中国影响的担忧，进一步损害中国在澳大利亚已经受损的形象。
“Over all there is a sense of overreach by China, and the way this statement is worded will compound that,” said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University.
“总的来说，这里有一种中国的手伸得太远的感觉，大使馆的声明使用的措辞将会加剧这种感觉，”澳大利亚国立大学国家安全学院院长罗里·梅德卡夫(Rory Medcalf)说。“这个声明将被澳大利亚一些圈子里的人视为毫无帮助、且充满挑衅。”
“This statement will be seen as unhelpful and provocative in some circles in Australia.”
“这个声明将被澳大利亚一些圈子里的人视为毫无帮助、且充满挑衅。”
China has long treated Australia as a laboratory for soft power experiments, flexing its economic muscle, sending students to study at its universities and creating organizations with close ties to the Communist Party.
长期以来，中国一直把澳大利亚当作测试软实力的实验室，在澳大利亚展示自己的经济实力，派留学生到澳大利亚的大学学习，还在该国建立了与中国共产党关系密切的组织。
Australia’s loose and opaque campaign finance laws have made the country especially vulnerable to outside influence.
澳大利亚的不受约束、而且不透明的竞选财务法，让这个国家特别容易受到外部的影响。
Earlier this year, Australia’s intelligence chief identified two prominent businessmen of Chinese descent, who have donated millions of dollars across the political spectrum in recent years, as possible agents for the Chinese government.
今年早些时候，澳大利亚情报部门的负责人将两位有名的华裔商人认定为中国政府的可能代理人，这两人近年来给各个不同政治派别的人捐献了数百万美元的资金。
Since then, Australia has been engaged in an intensifying discussion about whether to accept or resist China’s dominance in the region.
那之后，澳大利亚就一直在对接受、还是抵制中国在该地区的主导地位的问题进行日益激烈的讨论。
The debate has sharpened recently amid accusations that Senator Sam Dastyari of the opposition Labor Party hewed to Chinese foreign policy on some issues after accepting money from Chinese-born political donors.
最近有人指责，反对党工党的参议员邓森(Sam Dastyari)在接受了中国出生的政治捐款人的钱之后，在某些问题上执行中国的外交政策，在这种指责声中，讨论已变得更为激烈。
The proposed new foreign influence laws are one clear result of such concerns.
新的反外国影响法提案是这种担忧的一个明显后果。
But it is unclear to what extent China is concerned about the laws themselves.
目前还不清楚中国对这个法律本身有多大程度的担忧。
One provision would require people working on behalf of another country to register with the Australian government, as is mandated in the United States.
提案中有一条规定，要求为他国工作的人在澳大利亚政府登记注册，美国已有这种强制性的规定。
Among the other proposals, there are plans to create an offense known as unlawful interference in Australia’s political system, which would include behaviors — as yet unspecified — that harm the national interest.
其他提议包括建立一个名为非法干涉澳大利亚政治制度罪名的方案，这个罪名将覆盖损害国家利益的行为，但尚未具体说明哪些行为损害国家利益。
Some people who are especially concerned about Chinese interference in Australia have welcomed the proposals as much-needed counterweights.
一些特别担心中国干预澳大利亚事务的人对立法提案表示欢迎，认为这是抗衡干预所必需的。
“This is an exciting development indeed, although it should have happened earlier,” said Feng Chongyi, a Chinese-born professor at the University of Technology Sydney who has often criticized China’s suppression of dissent.
“这确实是一个令人兴奋的进展，虽然早就该这样做了，”悉尼科技大学(University of Technology Sydney)的华裔教授冯崇义说，他经常批评中国压制不同意见。
China may see the laws as inevitable, he said.
中国也许认为这些法律是迟早的事，他说。
If that is the case, some experts argue, the embassy’s statement Wednesday may in fact be an effort to pressure the Australian news media, and to influence how the media is perceived by the Chinese Australian community.
如果真是这样的话，一些专家认为，中国大使馆周三的声明实际上可能是对澳大利亚新闻媒体施加压力、同时影响澳大利亚华人社会对媒体看法的一种努力。
The embassy statement focused intensely on media accounts of “so-called Chinese influence and infiltration,” arguing that they were “made up out of thin air” and reflected “a typical anti-China hysteria.”
大使馆的声明主要针对的是“炮制所谓中国对澳进行影响渗透”的媒体报道，称这些报道“捕风捉影”，反映了“典型的歇斯底里”反华情绪。
It also argued that Australia’s discussion about China’s role has “unscrupulously vilified the Chinese students as well as the Chinese community in Australia with racial prejudice, which in turn has tarnished Australia’s reputation as a multicultural society.”
声明还认为，澳大利亚关于中国角色的讨论，“对在澳中国留学生及华侨华人进行肆无忌惮的中伤，充满种族歧视色彩，玷污了澳大利亚作为多元文化社会的形象。”
John Fitzgerald, a professor at Swinburne University who spent five years representing the Ford Foundation in China, said the Chinese government seemed to be trying to portray itself as the defender of Chinese Australians against the Australian news media.
斯威本大学(Swinburne University)教授费约翰(John Fitzgerald)曾作为福特基金会中国首席代表在中国工作了五年。他说，中国政府似乎正试图把自己描绘为澳大利亚华人的捍卫者，与他们一起与澳大利亚的新闻媒体抗争。
“The embassy itself is stirring up concerns within the Chinese Australian community that have no foundation,” Mr. Fitzgerald said, adding: “The media is not attacking the Chinese Australian community.
“大使馆本身正在澳大利亚华人社区内激起一种没有任何根据的担忧，”费约翰说，他补充说：“媒体攻击的不是澳大利亚的华人社区。
The media is being very specific about Communist Party interference in this country.”
媒体的目标非常具体：中国共产党对这个国家的干预。”
So far, Australian officials have chosen not to escalate the argument.
澳大利亚官员们到目前为止选择了不让这种争论升级的做法。
Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the Australian government “enjoys a respectful and constructive relationship with China.”
澳大利亚外交部长朱莉·毕晓普(Julie Bishop)周三晚间在一份声明中说，澳大利亚政府“与中国保持着尊重和建设性的关系”。
Mr. Medcalf said the statement from the Chinese Embassy had one line that could be helpful: “China has no intention to interfere in Australia’s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations.”
梅德卡夫说，中国大使馆的声明中有一句话可能会有点用：“中方无意干涉澳内政，也无意通过政治献金影响澳政治进程。”
